# User stories

[Personas in action](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/#user-personas):

- Sasha, the Software Developer. Their main job is to ship business applications.
- Allison, the Application Operator. Their main job is 2nd day operations of business applications.
- Priyanka, the Platform Engineer. Their main job is to enable Allison and Sasha to do their job.

Devon, the DevOps engineer is left out on purpose as DevOps is a bloated term that hardly fits a persona, its more of a role.
